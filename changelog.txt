-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release notes
---------------------------------------
InfoGlue 2.1 Final is released. 
Although a lot of critical bugfixes has been made this is much more than a patch-upgrade. This new release has now already been running a few weeks  
in several major production sites and has now proven that the 2.0 version has gotten rid of all the initial bugs and is production ready 
even for high end sites. There are several medium-big changes in this release and the overall stability of the platform has been improved even further.
Look at the huge changelog for more information.

Thanx to all involved!!

- InfoGlue 2.0 RC1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release notes
---------------------------------------
The InfoGlue Team is very pleased to finally announce the first Release Candidate of version 2.0.
This release is by far the largest effort yet and since we incorporated JSR 168 and enhanced workflow support the platform has taken a big leap into the portal and enterprise content management area. As a comment we are also very happy to see that the user community is growing fast even though we have neglected marketing at the moment. 
Quite a few large organisations are now in the last stages of launching InfoGlue-based sites and the release of 2.0 will hopefully get even more companies to consider it.

Thanx to all involved!!
