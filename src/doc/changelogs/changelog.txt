Release notes
---------------------------------------
We are happy to announce the immediate availability of the summer release of InfoGlue.
The new release is a new big step towards better usability in InfoGlue. Efforts has been made
to allow more work to be done directly in the decorated site view (edit on sight). 
A number of new features/screens to support this is implemented and many of the screens have been 
updated with what will later become the new GUI for 3.0.

For system administrators and DBA:s we are happy to announce a few features that will strongly limit the 
growth of the database. 
    
Thanx for all reports and proposals for bugfixes.
The InfoGlue Team


Abbreviated Changelog from 2.8.2 Final 
---------------------------------------
- Added a new subscription infrastructure. This let's users subscribe (when implemented in full) on selected interceptionPoints. This means they will get an email about events.
- I18n-adjusted more labels in the system.
- Improved new toolbar system
- Made it possible to state a displayName which differs from the name of a component-property. Nice for your users.
- Added new tag "EditOnSight" which puts a function button on the page with all infoglue features.
- Added possibility to better control custom icons per content type.
- Added possibility to style state-information in the tree-views. 
- Added new setting which let's you hide component-properties the user are not allowed to edit.
- Worked on subscriptions, new design for inline actions and a lot more.
- Worked more on subscriptions, a new translation screen and the new edit on sight tag.
- Worked on new component property features
- Improved the ViewInlineOperationsMessages action which is great for allowing actions to end up in a summary screen with several choices for the user.
- Added double-click feature to edit on sight. Inline editing that is.
- Added new property attribute 'propertyDisplayName' so one can have a different visual name from the programatic name used.
- Added state info to content toolbar area
- Updated to fit the new handling where published versions can be edited directly and handles versioning itself
- Worked on new properties for 
	- state styling (working, publish, published)
	- Being able to state if protected properties should be hidden.
	- Better possibility to state custom icons in tree.
	- Possible to state if the new version cleanup job should only keep published versions.
- Made subscriptions not be propagated through callback mechanism.
- Improved the content cleaner so it can clean only working/publish versions. Also possible to state how many back in time.
- Added possibility to have different toolbars for different fields in a content type.	
- Made quite some changes to make it possible for the user to edit a published copy and it automatically changes into a working copy without any extra user interaction.
- Added new interception points:
	- Content.ExpireDateComingUp
	- SiteNode.ExpireDateComingUp
- New test-help-method. Remove perhaps? ??????????
- Added synchronization on ChangeNotificationController
- Updated DocumentConverterHelper a lot - it now honors the new digitalAsset tree
- Automatically disable the pagecache for decorated views
- Added new rewrite attribute to DocumentConverterTag
- Worked on making the tree in content and structure show more info.
- New my settings screen
- Made last modified not be written in working/preview environments... only in live.
- Fixed issue with null input stream in some asset handling situations.
- Updated so inline dialogs get's handled better on small screens.
- Added possibility to set smtp-port in mail settings
- Added cache control headers in non published mode
- Fixed issue where direct publishing is made from a remote content service tag.
- Added logic for a new parameter for content type attribute. WYSIWYGExtraConfig can be set to any javascript.
- Made PageAttribute tag not demand the value attribute. This is so if only stated with name it outputs the value of the attribute with that name.
- Added new cool preProcessing possibility for components. This allows components and in some respect portlets to communicate internally before the renderphase which allows for a much more interactive and dynamic page. 
- Added some parameters (CacheResult, UpdateInterval, CacheKey and PreProcessingOrder) as fixed system properties for all components and show them under a advanced part.
- Improved the button javascript for close.
- Fixed issues with asset handling and store assets on disk (not in database).
- Implemented preProcessing of page so components can communicate with each other by passing data to each other.
- Made it possible to add a new tag <ig:lastModifiedDateTime format="yyyy-MM-dd HH:ss"></ig:lastModifiedDateTime> on a page if you want the latest date on all contents used on the page to be written. That is the same date also given in the HTTP-headers.
- Added automatic resize and some button classes to new v3-interfaces.
- Added logic to warn when expiration dates are closing on content or sitenodes.
- Fixed content and structure tool toolbar arrows bug in Firefox 3
- Made edit on sight open larger edit window.
- Added two new parameters:
  * niceURICharacterMapping which allows you to state how individual chars should be converted when auto-creating nice uri:s.
  * NiceURIForceLowerCase which allows you to force all nice URI:s to become lowercase.
- Added so structure tool (menu and tree) follows the activity in the preview/edit on sight. 
- Worked on a new edit on sight menu with better looks and better features.
- Added new automatic attributes to content versions when publishing. IGAuthorFullName and IGAuthorEmail. 
  The idea is that those fields can be used if a user has been removed from the auth system. LDAP:s never inform IG so we can use that as a fallback mechanism.
- Upgraded jquery to 1.2.6
- Made default page cache key consider pricipal. 
- Added possibility to turn off deletion of assets in work and live cache update threads. Needed for situations where you let the applications share one single digitalAssetDirectory.
- Fixed so any default value defined in content type also is reflected in "create content wizard".
- Added new field type in content types. The new customfield is targeted at organisations / developers 
  who want to extend the content types with anything that you can do in html/javascript. You can fill in a piece of html/javascript code directly in the field-attrribute and thereby make the form behave as you want.
- Fixed bug in IE7 in which if you used border-collapse: collapse; in your site infoglue:s hidden elements were outlined anyway.
- Added new binding property attribute and a tag(content:contentDetailPageUrl) which makes infoglue derive a page where the content you push on a startpage for example is bound in the sub structure. This is nice in some situations where you want to push a subpage by using the leadin the main article on that page has without having both to state the page and the content. Now you only bind the content so the leadin can be fetched and then infoglue finds the page for you. If there are several pages with a content a list below the property is shown and you can select which detail page to use.
- Upgraded to Saxon 9
- Added possibility to have custom fields (you write your own markup) for component properties in the structure editor.
- Improved repository export / import feature so it now also transfers properties and access rights (roles/groups right only for security reasons).
- Improved so if only one SiteNodeTypeDefintion exists in the system root site nodes gets that automatically. Helps a little for new users.
- Added so you can state transformation settings on each asset key if you want. Also - you can state assetKeyPattern in global transformation settings.
- Added property so you can state if you wish to have assets duplicated allways or only when changed between versions.

- Added possibility to enable password encryption when using infoglue:s built in authentication system. All passwords will be encrypted in the database with the SHA-1 algorithm.

- Improved the password-changed mail template a bit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release notes
---------------------------------------
The autumn release 2007 of InfoGlue is here. As usual the new version includes a lot of major and minor changes.
Performance and security are allways improved but finetuning of existing features and bugfixes are also included.

Check out the changelog below for details. 

Thanx to all involved!!

The InfoGlue Team


Abbreviated Changelog from 2.5.0 Final 
---------------------------------------
- Added a new feature which let's you delete all children for a certain content.
- Fixed performance problem in import repository feature when you have a huge installation.
- Updated to OSCache 2.4
- Fixed a new default LRU-algorithm class for OSCache which actually throws away objects when they don't fit in the LRU-cache anymore. The default class shipped with OSCache only invalidated it - it was never removed and could hence not be garbage collected.
- Added possibility to have a thumbnail for each component/HTMLTemplate and also add a description which can then be seen when one tries to add a component and look at the component list dialog.
- Added support for checkboxes in component properties
- Added warning if non-binding properties was edited but not saved in the component editor view when one clicks to assign a binding property. This is so one does not loose the changes automatically.
- Added new tag which can return many values for a property. For example if it's the new checkbox-property a user may choose several options. The tag is called <structure:componentPropertyValues>.
- A new content export / import feature is now available in the content tool.
- Added new methods in componentLogic to get a list of property bound pages or contents on a target siteNode. Before those methods only returned single entities.
- Updated task executor so it supports jsp and freemarker
- Added new property which controls if sites should enforce identity checkup through SSO-plugins even if the pages are not protected. Use with care.
- Fixed bug with message center messages look & feel.
- Added possibility to set that a certain content binding requires which asset to use and also interfaces for the choose dialog.
- Added logic so "EditOnSight" works on the base component - before it worked only on all other sub components.
- Added possibility to set which asset keys should be mandatory to upload - used currently only by the create content wizard but should later be implemented by the save content version / publish actions.
- Added better handling of assets to the create content wizard available next to content binding properties in structure tool. Now mandatory assets are required and additional assets can be uploaded and they can then be used when editing the wysiwyg fields like normal.
- Added new structure:siteNodesFromWebPages-tag which allows easy conversion between a list of WebPage-beans and SiteNodeVO:s which are more suitable for advanced sorting etc.
- Added parsing/el-expressions of siteNodeId on the tag structure:siteNode.
- Added timeout handling in webservice handler (30 seconds)
- Removed bold on a:active - it led to some issues with moving texts upon clicked.
- Included saxon 8.9 in the distribution and created a new tag for transforming with it. It is much faster and less memory expensive than Xalan. Saxon is a XSLT 2.0, XQuery 1.0, and XPath 2.0 conformant processor.
- Removed mail and activation from the local classpath - apache tomcat and others allready includes it.
- Fixed bug in access right view and also fixed so the rows are colored in different colors like all other lists.
- Added new attribute on Include-tag so one now can state if the relation include should be using attribute language fallback. Defaults to true.
- Added a new document conversion tag which operates together with JODConverter (Open Office serverside). It can take a worddocument and convert it on the fly to pdf, odf and html. Our tag also manages to create table of contents separately so you can have navigation separate.
- Fixed so page templates images are scaled down to a conformed format in screens where they are used. Messes up GUI if to large.
- Added scroll-possibility to both structure and content toolbars so buttons can be reached even though the screen resolution is limited.
- Moved task button in content toolbar - decreased importance
- Upgraded to mysql-connector 5.0.7 JDBC driver.
- Added new assets-tag which returns a list of DigitalAssetsVO objects for a content/property binding. This is also available to velocity/freemarker-templates through the templateController-API.
- Added possibility to assetUrl-tag and assetThumbnailUrl-tag so you can state the digitalAssetId directly if you know it. Nice in conjunction with the new assets-tag. This is also available to velocity/freemarker-templates through the templateController-API.
- Fixed bug in URLComposer which led to // at the end of nice-uri:s when constructing url to another repository.
- Added possibility to have different login page for each repository. Just define a loginUrl in the repostory extra properties.
- Added possibility to have different error page for each repository. Just define a errorUrl in the repostory extra properties.
- Fixed bug when disabling and enabling languages which led to "null" in properties edit window.
- Added settings so you can configure if protected contents / sitenodes are to be shown to persons without access in the tool trees.
- Added a setting that enables a more rigid content access enforcement. Very important if working with intranets as the default setting is no good as it caches attributes without principal as key for memory and performance reasons.
- Added an attribute / method in DeliveryContext-object which can control so that non published contents are shown anyway in working mode. You have to set it in the components you want this behaviour.
- Added an attribute and flags on most methods which are of interest which allows you to state if property-inheritance should be limited to the page. Default is page + structure above as before.
- Added a create sitenode wizard (just like the create content wizard) so one can create a sitenode while binding a page to a property.

user-interface improvements. Last but not least as usual there are some bugfixes and stability improvements.


Thanx to all involved!!

The InfoGlue Team


Abbreviated Changelog from 2.4.6 Final 
---------------------------------------
- Upgraded FCKEditor(the WYSIWYG-component in InfoGlue) to 2.4.2.
- Improved handling of Available service bindings - remove later completely :)
- Fixed error handling for when inconsistencies are not really there. Old nodes and contents not cleared out from the registry for example.
- Removed cmsUserName and repositoryName when opening preview window.
- Added new contentVersion tag for the cms workflows.
- Made it possible to assign a return address on the createDigitalAsset action so the save button can lead to a different view.
- Fixed bug in getMatchingContents which did not use the user db connection but started a new one.
- Added check so if a user sends in null or a id less than 1 it returns null allways. Saves a lot of errors in the logfiles.
- Fixed bug with overriding references when deleting a sitenode. The old code did not correctly delete the binding and it resulted in an error.
- Fixed issue with active users were counted wrong.
- Added method to get when latest publications were made.
- Changed the httphelper to not skip linebreak chars. 
- Fixed so one now can use non-ascii chars as digitalAssetKey. Two new encodings in app settings allow one to convert depending on server settings. Default settings usually works.
- Made the repositories be sorted by name in most views
- Improved performance and fault tolerance in repository export/import.
- Fixed issue with the Image-editor when using non-ascii user names.
- Fixed so displayName is shown in publishing lists and history instead of userName.
- Fixed nullpointer which occurred when an login failed in extranet.
- Fixed so validation errors gets focus when saving a content version.
- Fixed bug which made edit-on-sight fall back to normal edit view if a validation error occurred.
- Added possibility to have different icons in the content-tree for each content types. Rudimentary at the moment - you have to add an image file with the contentTypeDefinitionId in the infoglueCMS\script\xloadtree\images\xp\-folder.
- Fixed so the text searches with matchingContents etc on SQLServer works. Was a problem with how SQL-server escapes [-tags.
- Made a new webservice method which lets you get a contentVersion for a content remotely.
- Made it possible to have a ContentVersionVO as argument when using the contentAttribute-tag. Makes things easier when dealing with remote versions.
- Added speed improvements to ReferencingPages-tag.
- Added an experimental ClearCache-tag which would allow you to clear the caches from deliver based on that you know what you are doing. Not recommended yet.
- Made evaluation of whole page really not happen if set. Saves a lot of memory and performance on large pages.
- Made publications nor require unique names
- Fixed so language drop in tool-header is now shown if only one language is available.
- Upgraded dbcp to 1.2.2 which says it should solve some connection reset issues not being handled with grace.
- Fixed so JNDI and webservice caches are not cleared upon publication. No need - they time out themselves.
- Made the search view when binding contents better visually - now the path to the found content is only displayed when clicking on the questionmark.
- Added fields and logic to control which languages are available in the tool header.
- Improved handling of assets a lot so now the blob in them are only loaded when needed.
- Added possibility to change content type on any content.
- Fixed so the cas authentication module does not send so many redirects to the CAS-server. It tries to minimize the redirects to just a few actions.
- Added two new taglibs for extracting access rights for a page or other object - that is what roles, users and groups are allowed to access it.
- Fixed issue with logout when running CAS
- Added a new alternative way of making content category searches (matching contents tag etc). Improves performance for complex expressions hugely. 
- Added possibility to control which version of the content search controller should be used in management tool with a new setting. The new default is the improved much faster search method.
- Added support for unicode names in asset keys
- Fixed so the mouse over symbol is hand when choosing repository in publishingtool. 
- Added new webservice API:s for creating, updating and deleting users in InfoGlue. 
- Added new diff-tag which operates on two strings
- Added new contentVersions-tag which fetches all published versions in a certain language.
- Added two new settings concerning dates on pages and contents. 
	1. First one makes it possible to state if the date fields should be editable in combination with the calendar-popup. 
	2. Second one states the default number of years you want expireDateTime on pages and contents should be set to. 
	   Default is 50 years which is perhaps to long for some organisations and now they can set a default value themselves.
- Added a flag on most tags which allows you to disable repository inheritance when looking up properties.
- Fixed issues with updating digitalAssets not being propagating correctly through the digitalAsset caches due to the new SmallDigitalAsset concept.
- Implemented cleanup of content-versions when a user chooses to force removal of inline links and inline images which references a content/page the user wants to delete.
- Fixed better cookie-handling so the menu tree better remembers the expansion of your sites.
- Added a refresh icon to the left menu which lets the user refresh the menu and reset all tool-cookies. Often needed after a while to get the three expansion to work as it should.
- Fixed so the same description tooltip are used for all properties.
- Added so one can search for contents in the inline asset dialog and only get those contents which has an asset on them and the asset name or key matches the searched keyword.
- Made input encoding filter configurable at build-time with properties.
- Made component editor view (structure tool view) consider available tool languages when choosing localized labels for edit on sight etc.
- Added cache-possibility to the matchingContents-tag and implements a default caching.
- Added possibility to add categories to an rss/atom feed with a new common:rssFeedEntryCategory-tag.
- Added new webservices for a lot of authorization framework operations. Approved applications can now use the infoglue users/roles/groups through webservices.
- Added drag/drop support for the multi-binding-views (content and structure) both from the tree to the selection list and you can also sort the list by dragging the items in it to new positions.
- Upgraded the jsdiff-component - some bugs in it is now removed and you can state your own css-styling for the diff elements.
- Improved ViewApplicationState-view with sorting of components based on average time and also added how many hits the average was based on. 
- Added app start date in application state and cleaned up so the data do not contain MB or ms in the text itself but rather on the labels.
- Added possibility to move components up and down in a slot through the edit on sight feature. Previously only reachable through the page structure view.
- Added possibility to turn off the custom icons in content tool tree as this is a huge performance issue on some browsers on mac.
- Added possibility to use the contentVersionTag with contentVersionId instead of content and language. Not for normal use really but useful sometimes.

The InfoGlue Team


Abbreviated Changelog from 2.4.1 Final 
---------------------------------------
- InfoGlue now require Java 1.5
- Added fix so if the cas-ticket is first argument it will not be forgotten
- Fixed so one can state to user $currentUrl for cas-serviceURL in the cms-authentication filter as well. Before only one static url could be set.
- Added debug and fixed an issue where anonymous user could interfer with userBase in JNDI-lookups if not set
- Fixed so all url:s are protected in infoglueCMS - before only .action was protected. Instead added so one can specify url:s to allow in web.xml.
- Added user cache to avoid calls to LDAP
- Added finally-blocks to all jndi-context-uses so we clean up all connections even if errors occur
- Changed name on a css-class to avoid clashes with customer classes. .tab is now .igtab
- Added possibility to have a robots.txt in deliver
- Added thumbnail support for PNG-images and made edit-link only appear in front of gif, jpg and png assets in the content tool
- Made image editor a bit more robust - added some checks on crop and resize tools.
- Added feature which allows the system to send notifications to publishers when one or more items are submitted for publication. 
  The notification can either be sent to the publishers which is members of the same group as the submitter or to submitters in a particular group.
  The feature can be turned on/off through the application settings.
- Added feature so a publisher can filter the items submitted to publishing tool. One can look at all items, items submitted by members in any of my groups or items submitter by members of a particular group.
- Added sorting of workflows in my desktop tool so they are allways sorted by creation id
- Added better exception handling in os-workflow integration. Now the database can go down and OS-Workflow will recover when it's available again.
- Added more statistics to the ViewApplicationState-page - now one can see:
	* Total number of requests handled since deliver was started
	* Average processing time (time until response was delivered)
	* Slowest request time since start.
- Added warning mail if workflow engine get's into trouble
- Added so long requests are reported from liveservers to the admin email address.
- Added robots.txt file possibility
- Filter out more hibernate errors with log4j which are duplicates.
- Added so one can see long threads in BlockedThread.jsp
- Fixed so events up for publishing but which are for deleted content versions or site node versions are marked as broken and deleted 
- Tried to fix bug with inherited properties not being recognised for cache eviction when the meta info on the parent node was updated.
- Services are now not totally blocked by AuthenticationFilter.
- Made internal content search and replace work against multiple repositories at once.
- Added possibility to have meta data on InfoGluePrincipal and displayName on InfoGlueGroup and InfoGlueRole.
- Added new helper method to webservice helper which allows one to call a one string argument method.
- Fixed a bug which showed related allready published sitenodes as publishable when submitting to publish.
- Added an extraProperties-field to the repository properties-fields so one can define custom name-value-pairs and extract such information in the site templates.
- Added validation of authorization module in the validation service.
- Added a webservice authorization module. The format of the SOAP-response-content is IG-specifik (an xml string) but still - a new kind of flexibility for organisations to build their own middleware to collect the users, roles and groups for InfoGlue.
- Added a contentPath-attribute to the contentParameter-tag so one can get a directory structure created and the content put in that directory-structure.
- Added a new GenericCombinedAuthorizationModule which allows one to combine any number of similar or different authorization-modules. For example is one wants to combine two LDAP-directories and then InfoGlue:s own it's easy now.
- Added warning message when you log in as root user so users understand do use another account for normal use.
- Added better webservice security
- Added possibility to delete published contents through the webservice
- Improved the generic combined auth module and how the delegated adaptors should handle caches.
- Added logic to allow enable languages on specific pages and their subpages. Complements the disable languages feature.
- Fixed bug in import repository which made contents loose their content types.
- Worked on more advanced component statistics - now one can get average processing time on each component.
- Added possibility to add timeout on http requests from within HttpHelper
- Made all list in the administrative tools sortable on their columns.
- Made it possible to reset the component statistics
- Added handling of focus to links to remove dotted line around it in firefox
- Made content and siteNodes modifyer it's own colum in publish screens so it's sortable
- Added caching on url-encoding to save object creation
- Changed the parser helper for dom4j and how it parses a document - not dependent on xerces DOM any more - instead uses a sax-method to keep memory use down.
- Optimized parts of the deliver engine to use StringBuilder instead of Strings and other performance and memory usage improvements.
- Added a method in the AuthenticationModule which states if a module enforces J2EE security
- Fixed a more correct view of the caches in ViewApplicationState
- Added possibility to control the size of each cache listed in ViewApplicationState - great way to tune memory usage.
- Added new log viewer inside the management tool and from ViewApplicationState.action which allows you to sort of "tail" the important log files. This way you can debug without having access to server.
- Made modified date in content search result into standard format and it's own column so it's sortable.
- Added possibility to control how large the advanced caches can be through the management tool. Very useful for trimming memory consumption.
- Added possibility to search for a content in the content binding dialog. Very useful if you have a huge content mass and don't really know where the content you want is located.
- Improved the statistics of the ViewApplicationState to refelect the sizes of the caches better.
- Added new filtering logic to the content webservices to avoid harmful code or similar external form submits. 
- Fixed so the getUsers(roleName) returns a list of full principals - not only shallow objects.
- Dramatically improved performance when listing all active workflows in mydesktop. Also beneficial for other apps using the API:s.
- Added new JNDI Authorization module which is a rewrite of the old module but is more strict and conforms better to standards and uses full names all over.
- Implemented displayName on principal, role and group so it's easier to build nicer GUI:s when assigning rights etc. When connecting LDAP-sources the fully qualified names are so long it gets hard to read.
- Made adjustments so if a user changes the meta info of a page it also changes the last modifyer and date of the page.
- Added 3 different XPath-handlers for property parsing to compare performance - Xalan, Dom4j and XPP3. For now XPP3 is used - can be configured if needed by setting a property in deliver.properties called "propertiesParser" - Can be "xalan", "dom4j" or "xpp3".
- Tried to improve performance by removing some synchronized blocks in the cache handling. Handles huge number of concurrent visitors better.
- Extended the MatchingContentsTag to also allow text search on any number of content attributes and possibility to limit serch to a specific period in time which can be a huge performance boast.
- Added <management:categoryPath-tag which let's you get the full path to a category. Important in followup searches based on assigned categories for example.
- Added new tag (<content:assignedCategories) and underlying methods to get all categories assigned to a content version. Very useful as part if you want to search for similar contents for example.
- Improved "Add component"-dialog performance hugely when dealing with a large number of components.
- Improved the create interception point dialog so all inactive system interception points (tehre are quite a few) are listed for quick activation.
- Added possibility to control access to all menu items in the management tool. Nice if you want to be able to have some users do only some administrative tasks like diagnosing logs or creating users but nothing else.  
- Created a new "Publish this page" button in structure which is not recursive as a complement to the normal recursive "Publish"-button.
- Added inconsistencies tool which allows you to track down faulty/broken references to deleted contents or pages or components. Also enables you to delete such references.
- Added feature so you now can specify disallowedComponentNames instead of allowedComponentNames on slots if you want. 
- Made so the inconsistenciesController gets a chance to remove references to stuff that are getting deleted.
- Added so warning mail, which can be sent when a page takes more than x seconds, contains what other long thread are active in the system. Of huge value from a debug perspective.
- Added pageing of users in management tool > System users - 100 at a time.
- Added possibility to specify any number of approved roles as authContraint (access to cms tools). Separate them with ; and you are done.
- Added new settings to control how InfoGlue handles huge load. The settings allow you to state if the deliver engine shall limit how many threads should excecute at once. 
  As to many threads at a time results in syncronizing issues and possibly memory issues it is sometimes nice to be able to limit the number to for example 50 concurrent threads. 
  The new threads coming in would be kept waiting until another thread finishes and the idea is that you should set the limit to a size that suits your servers and the load it has.
  Dont mess with these settings if you don't experience problems or if you don't know what it's doing.
- Added logic so a warning email will be sent to the warningEmailRecipient when the memory is dropping below 15% of the maximum java heap size. Consider this an early warning system. Only one mail per application life cycle is sent.  
- Added taglib and logic to invoke workflow actions remotely
- Upgraded to Velocity 1.5 - check the changelog for that project. Hopefully the inline macro issues have really been solved as they say.
- Made all cache update actions and validators time out after 3 seconds. We have seen strange results when remote services hang.
- Fixed a new Import-tag which should be able to replace the normal jstl-import tag which cannot handle timeouts etc well.
- Made better error message handling when lock not granted exceptions due to simultaneous editing occur.
- Made it possible to control if live also should kill long threads and also allow live to have another timeout for when to kill threads.
- Updated the Apache Axis packages to 1.5.1
- Upgraded to Rome 0.9 (RSS libraries)
- Made it possible to state contentId instead of propertyName for tag content:assetThumbnailUrl.
- Fixed bug in access control when protecting which users are allowed to create sitenodes under a sitenode. It behaves correct now.
- Fixed issue with window positioning in IE sometimes
- Moved buttons in masspublishing/unpublishing screens, so that it conforms more with the other screens
- Added new principalContentVersions taglib which lets you look up all contents last modified by a certain user and perhaps is nearing expireDate. Useful in intranets or similar.
- Added tag to get all siteNodes referencing a certain content. Useful for finding where to show a detailed view
- Improved performance hugely on getAllUsers on InfoGlueBasicAuthorizationModule.
- Added tag for getting url that changes the current page language
- Made it possible to in the ig:slot-declaration state if access rights should be disables on that slot. 
  Helpful for when you wish to secure only some slots. No need to set access rights on all slots this way. Use disableAccessControl="true".
- Tried to fix IE7-layout issues with tree navigation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- InfoGlue 2.4.1 Final
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release notes
---------------------------------------
This is a bug-fix release for 2.4 which seems to have been released a bit premature. Thanx for the feedback all!!
Everybody must use this rather than 2.4.

Thanx to all involved!!

The InfoGlue Team


Abbreviated Changelog from 2.4 Final 
---------------------------------------
- Fixed so export file names are converted to avoid i18n-chars when exporting a repository
- Added a new section in management tool for archiving and restoring assets of old content versions. 
  This allows administrators to minimize the database space taken by InfoGlue. Up to 90 % of the database are usually digital assets so it can save a lot of backup space and time.
- Added principal to recursive deletion check for site nodes and contents - there was a flaw in protection before on that point
- Fixed flaw in InfoGlueJDBCPropertySet which gave errors when trying to save data in completely fresh databases
- Fixed a bug in content version edit - FCKEditor has changed and interfers with body onload so now we do it in the script-part instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- InfoGlue 2.4 Final
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release notes
---------------------------------------
The InfoGlue Team are happy to release the best version yet. InfoGlue 2.4 is available for immediate download.
This release contains so many impovements it's hard to say what to lift up. Stability, performance and security is allways in focus of course so quite
a few changes and improvements have been made in those areas. Check out the long list of improvements below.

Thanx to all involved!!

The InfoGlue Team


Abbreviated Changelog from 2.3.5 Final 
---------------------------------------
- Made InfoGlueGroup, InfoGlueRole and InfoGluePrincipal implement serializable so context can share them within a tomcat or in a cluster.
- Added new J2EE-authentication module. It allows one to let the container handle login and infoglue deliver accepts it's principal.
- Added new JDBC Authorization module (experimental so far).
- Changed PortalServletRequest so portlets get the principal object propagated in a better way.
- Changed ViewPage.action so if the user is authenticated by the container it at least asks the authentication module if it's ok.
- Added a protectedRediect which may be used later for container managed auth.
- Made it possible to dictate for the delivery engine from a component that a page should be trimmed before sent to the client. This means components returning xml as a result don't have to be written on one line to avoid invalid xml any more. 
- Completed all classes which uses OQLQuery with closing of OQL and QueryResults object. Fixes issues with max cursors in Oracle and releases resources better.
- Improved mydesktop so any workflows with faulty definitions are not loaded and an warning message are shown next to them.
- Added failcheck for very old version of InfoGlue Databases in validation code
- Enabled user to set new property controlling requests timeout in deliverWorking and preview. Also made system properties come back trimmed so extra spaces are removed. 
- Updated admin tools with a new date picker (jscalendar from dynarch). Much smoother handling and skinnable.
- Made it possible to set onclick on submit buttons used in workflows.
- Added mailer-taglib in web.xml i deliver
- Made fix to avoid ?null after login when no request parameters are available.
- Made module a bit better to avoid dubble / in context
- Made it possible to control what link-classes are available in the FCKEditor from the javascript-init. 
- Changed so the JNDIAuthorizationModule supports SSL and also anonymous bind etc.
- Fixed some css-mistakes
- Improved JNDIAuthorizationModule with several aspects including reuse of bind-operations, case insensitivity and some failover
- Made listings of users, roles and groups sorted on user names
- Added authorization converter and test case. 
- Fixed bug in group handling in LDAP Authorization Module
- Improved authentication mechanism so users, roles and groups can be tagged to be update:able and delete:able individually so several sources can be used.
- Added a new AuthorizationModule which combines a JNDI and InfoGlue's own auth module into one source.
- Improved Authorization system so any number of sources can be combined and each user/role/group can be edited etc if that source it came from supports it.
- Added new JDBC/Infoglue authorization module which can combine those two sources.
- Worked more on having a single source for database definitions for all frameworks which are also manageable through a interface. This is to be able to drop the infoglue wars in the app server and then just set up the database connection and go from there. Not ready yet.
- Defeated the IE cache refresh bug which before made tree not update after change in Internet Explorer.
- Fixed an option when importing so only the latest versions are imported.
- Made intuitive rights transfer GUI:s so one can duplicate one user's/group's/role's rights to another. This makes it easier to move between authorization systems. 
- Added fix so that internal http-calls from InfoGlue does not trigger the update cache filter as that can lead to locks in working environment and a hung system. 
- Made JNDI adaptor more efficient and adding a possibility to cache roles, users and groups for a period of time (definable for each in properties).
- Added possiblity to delete old content versions so one can clean up a huge database. A new button comes up when you enter a earlier version than the latest.
- Changed so table width when used in FCKEditor by default is set to 75% instead of pixels
- Upgraded to FCKEditor 2.3.1 from the 2.2 version we had before
- Improved import utility by adding failchecks, better handling of errors and also fixed bug which did not account for relations to contents and pages created by a relation editor.'
- Fixed bug in component caching which could lead to wrong component being fetched. 
- Added better caching in some areas (content types, component properties) which improves dynamic pages a lot and decreases the xml/xpath cost.
- Fixed bug with opener reload in mozilla when in edit on sight mode. We used <body onload="javascript:.." before and that seems to be working bad - changed to window.onload in javascript.
- Added dbcp-pool on InfoGlueJDBCPropertySet until we completely remove it. Decreases the load on the database server quite a bit.
- Started working on transferring property sets - now optional beta
- Started working on a cleaning function which cleans out broken references to components etc.
- Added cms full base url so we can handle any references between the deliver app and the cms.
- Changed so we don't have multiple NullObjects.
- Changed log4j-references to local variable instead of getLogger() - a bit faster.
- Added toString()-method on BrowserBean so one can debug browser easily in templates
- Worked on beta feature which allows one to save a page as a digitalAsset (suitable for css and javascript nodes for example to avoid overhead).
- Added improved access right check so now one has to have repository access to the repository holding the content to be able to edit it.
- Improved the ViewApplicationState.action page so users are listed last - not in the middle
- Fixed bug in logonUrl-handling
- Fixed so repositories can be placed below other repositories dns-names like http://www.mycomp.com/sitex
- Fixed so deliver working and preview can be protected and that the decorated view never can be shown in live mode.
- Removed a few e.printStacktrace() in favour for more log4j-statements and also modified the log4j.xml to not show messeges about mapping of url failing or components missing in the standard log but in a infoglue log instead. All severe errors should still come out in the normal catalina log.
- Fixed so one can have steps in workflows on other servers and also jump between protocols like http and https.
- Made fix so remoteUserProperties-tag actually cares about the language-id sent in.
- Fixed so application handles https-situations better
- Decreased castor-cache to 5000 on the content version entity to limit the memory footprint a bit.
- Removed hard set of javax.xmk.transform.TransformFactory in PortletDispatcher - was messing with other applications ect and was marked as just a test.
- Made startup output a bit nicer and more informative
- Added more debug info to broken component references so one can see exact which page has the broken reference.
- Added check for sitenodes with no siteNodeVersions - only found on siteNodes with no metaInfoContentId however. After an upgrade from 1.3.2 to 2.4 for example we suggest one run validation at least 2 times to optimize the database.
- Made more setPropertyName methods in taglibs evaluate expressions
- Fixed a workaround to problem with empty slots allowing users with no access to save page template to still do it. Now they get an error when trying.
- Made so warnings such as broken references to components etc are handled by a rolling file appender and stored in each webapps logs directory.
- Made it possible to statein the deliveryContext-object that a page should not be evaluated a final time by velocity after all components has been evaluated. Improves performance but can lead to different behaviour in your sites.
- Worked more on a logging system which is dynamic and still divides the files in severity. 
- Added indexes to digitalAsset table which improves performance on portlet-handling a lot if your database is big.
- Made the system sense when properties are not available in a language one has chosen in the structure-tool editor. Before they were blank or undefined if you choose a language not supported on that page 
- Added so inputCharacterEncoding can be different for cms and deliver i application settings. No more need to mess around in web.xml for that.
- Made ContentSort tag accept a custom comparator - very neat - now you can have InfoGlue use your own custom class for sorting. If the comparator implements TemplateControllerAwareComparator it can also use the templateController-object for lookups in InfoGlue. 
- Fixed a bug which made old page binding be valid if newer versions of a sitenode does not have that binding. Now it should work fine again. This bug only concerned people building sites the old way without components.
- Added better nullchecks for sites that for some reason have pages which has no versions. Only happens when old sites are being upgraded. New sites (build with 2.0 and above) does not have such pages. 
- Removed reference between ServiceDefinition and it's ServiceBindings as no queries go that way and it affects performance to much. Should make no difference to anyone.
- Added alfa version of simple image editor - can be disabled in application settings.
- Updated installer and infoglue login screens with a new logo
- Changed colors a bit in my desktop to a less intense color.
- Fixed so sublist tag now behaves as intended. You state a startIndex and how many elements you want.
- Made errors (404 etc) in cms be directed to error page and not to the tool main action.
- Added error check in ViewSystemUser action - thrown if encoding settings are wrong and one uses userNames with non-ascii-chars.
- Upgraded oscache to 2.3.2 and fixed a small cache issue with component tree not being visualized right when adding slots
- Added so one can define the component cache key either in a component property called CacheKey or in a applikation property componentKey.
- Added experimental property for selective cache update of live servers in almost the same way working servers are updated.
- Added better caching of properties which are not found.
- Improved the new Pooling - before only 10 connections was pooled as a max - which could cause locks in high load sites. Now it's max 200 and configurable through the dbcp.maxActive property
- Changed usedXXX-lists to HashSets so no duplicates are handled - minimizes the cache updates.
- Improved how jsp files are written to disk before used to avoid thread issues
- Added experimental live cache eviction thread. Will make publishing much less heavy and faster as the objective with this class is to throw away only affected items in the cache. Much testing needs to be done though.
- Added methods to get the original full uri and original full querystring - they are usually modified by InfoGlue filters when they reach the templates.
- Improved how attributes and url contents are written to disk when used as assets
- Added possibility to control the pool size of os-propertyset
- Fixed better performance on content covers and site node covers - before central pages and templates could take very long to show.

Release notes

The InfoGlue Team is very pleased to finally announce the first Release Candidate of version 2.0.
This release is by far the largest effort yet and since we incorporated JSR 168 and enhanced workflow support the platform has taken a big leap into the portal and enterprise content management area. As a comment we are also very happy to see that the user community is growing fast even though we have neglected marketing at the moment. 
Quite a few large organisations are now in the last stages of launching InfoGlue-based sites and the release of 2.0 will hopefully get even more companies to consider it.
